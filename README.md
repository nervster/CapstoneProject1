# CapstoneProject1

My dataset is based on the Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk). The first step I have completed is my data wrangling step located in the Capstone1_Home_Credit_Group Jupyter Notebook File.

Jupyter Notebooks: 
  1. Data Wrangling: Located within Capstone1_Home_Credit_Group.ipynb where I aggregated, merged, and feature selected columns
  2. EDA: Located within Capstone1_Data_StoryTelling.ipynb where I used correlation analysis to find important feature
  
Other Documentation:
